    <title>Intro to DOM Manipulation</title>
</head>
<body>
   <!-- DOM document object model, and is what allows our JavaScript to interact with
the HTML and CSS of our page. DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of a
HTML page and how JS can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in 
the browser's window.

DOM is an object representation of a web page, which can be modidied with a scripting
language like JavaScript.
two primary functions:
    1.)Making a model of a HTML page
        -when the browser loads a webpage, it creates a model of the page in memory
        -the DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure the model in 
        what is called the DOM tree. the DOM is called an object model because the DOM
        tree is made of Objects(everything is an object.)
    2.)Accessing and changing the HTML page
        -the DOM also provides methods and properties to access and update each object in the model,
        which in turn updates what the user sees in the browser.

    usually when working with the DOM tree, we will access the element we want to work with, and then we 
    will modify, or manipulate it.

    ACCESSING:
        COMMON METHODS FOR ACCESSING A SINGLE ELEMENT
            -getElementById()
            -querySelector()

        COMMON METHODS FOR ACCESSING MULTIPLE ELEMENTS
            -querySelectorAll()
            -getElementByClassName()
            -getElementByTagName()

        MANIPULATION
            -COMMON METHODS FOR WORKING WITH HTML CONTENT:
                -innerHTML  //no parens() so a property not a methods
                -textContent
                -createElement
                
            COMMON METHODS FOR WORKING WITH TAG ATTRIBUTES
                -className / Id
                -setAttribute()
                -getAttribute()

    We can write javaScript directly by typing it within a <script>tag, similar to how we would write css in a 
        <style>tag  
    -->
            <!-- <script>
                // now we can write some javascript
                console.log('Hello from the script tag~');
            </script> -->

<!-- what if we want to use an external javascript file in this webpage? -->
    <script src="script.js"></script>
