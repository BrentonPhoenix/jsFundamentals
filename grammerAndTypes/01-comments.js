// A single line comment
// using / /    will comment out a single line, making this useful for notes

//we can use ctrl + / as a short cut to make a comment

/* Multi-Line comment */
/*
Using a / + a *
will create a new 
multi-line
comment
*/

// In VSCode, our shortcut to make a comment will also work within HTML and CSS in the same way, though the syntax will be slightly different

//comments are ignored when running code, anything inside of them will not be run wether it is valid code or otherwise.
//this makes comments very useful for debugging
